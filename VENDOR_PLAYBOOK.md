# WeTwo Wedding Buyers Club — Vendor Playbook
### Living document: learnings, positioning, and rules for the system

---

## VOICE & TONE RULES

1. **Talk like a sharp friend, not a textbook.** No walls of text. No math homework. Napkin math only.
2. **Average wedding gift = ~$150** (The Knot 2024 study). Close friends/family = $160+. Use this as the baseline.
   - 10% = $15/sale → 7 sales covers Starter plan → 50 sales = $650/month profit
   - 15% = $22.50/sale → Growth sweet spot
   - 20% = $30/sale → Pro tier for power vendors
3. **THE REGISTRY BOMB:** One couple's registry = 100-200 guests × $150 = $15,000-$30,000 in purchases. At 10% = $1,500-$3,000 from ONE couple. Lead with napkin math, then drop this number.
4. **Never sound like church.** This isn't about community or sharing with vendor friends. This is about competitive advantage and market share.
5. **Action-first.** Every page, every message should lead with "here's what to do" not "here's what to understand."

## COMMISSION MATH (SOURCE: THE KNOT 2024 GUEST STUDY + US NEWS + NERDWALLET)

- Average wedding gift: **$150/guest** (The Knot 2024). NerdWallet says $160-165.
- Close friends/family: **$160+**
- Couples attending together: **$200+**
- Guests willing to spend up to **$365-375** across all wedding events
- This is NOT a $100 impulse buy — these are considered, meaningful purchases.

**Per-sale math:**
- Starter (10%): $15/sale → **7 sales = plan covered**
- Growth (15%): $22.50/sale → **9 sales = plan covered**
- Pro (20%): $30/sale → **10 sales = plan covered**
- **Every plan pays for itself in under 10 sales.**

**Registry math (the big pitch):**
- Average wedding: 100-200 guests
- Average gift: $150
- Total registry purchases: $15,000 - $30,000
- At 10% commission: **$1,500 - $3,000 from ONE couple**
- At 15%: $2,250 - $4,500
- At 20%: $3,000 - $6,000
- Vendor works with multiple couples per year. Do the math.

## THE ONLY TOOL THAT PAYS YOU BACK

This is the single most powerful positioning line WeTwo has. Use it everywhere.

Every other tool wedding vendors pay for — The Knot, WeddingWire, HoneyBook, Dubsado, Flodesk, Instagram ads — takes their money and says "trust us, this will help you get clients eventually." No receipt. No direct line between the payment and money coming back in. It's always faith-based ROI.

**WeTwo is the only tool where the subscription generates trackable revenue per transaction.** Not "this might help you get a client." It's: you paid $97, you made $15 on this sale, here's your commission statement, 7 sales and you're in profit.

**But the commission is just the cherry on top.** The REAL ROI is what this system does for their main business:
- The landing page converts clicks into inquiries — one booking = $2,000-$10,000+
- The reactivation tool reopens doors to cold leads — one reopened conversation = one potential booking
- The network effect puts their name in front of 150+ people per couple — exposure money can't buy
- A SINGLE BOOKING from any of this pays for YEARS of membership

**Cost framing — ALWAYS lead with this:**
- Starter = $3.23/day — a cup of coffee
- Growth = $6.57/day — less than lunch
- Pro = $9.90/day — lunch money
- **The expense won't change their life. But what it unlocks absolutely can.**

**The line:** "Name one other tool you pay for that pays you back. This is the only one."

This isn't a SaaS tool. This is a business growth engine with a commission bonus built in.

---

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

- **NEVER tell vendors to share with other vendors.** The fewer vendors in their area who have this, the bigger their edge.
- Frame everything as: "This is YOUR edge. Use it to grab market share."
- "When a couple is choosing between you and the next vendor, this tips the scale."
- "No other [category] in your area can offer this."
- The program is invitation-only for a reason — scarcity = value.

## UPGRADE LEVERS

### The Core Reframe
The expense is trivial. The result can be life-changing. Commission is spending money — the cherry on top. The real value is what this system does for their main business. One booking = $2,000-$10,000+. That's the real math.

### Free → Starter ($97/mo = $3.23/day — a cup of coffee)
- Your links work but you earn $0. You're leaving money on the table.
- 7 sales/month covers the plan. Everything after that is profit.
- But the real win: you get listed in the WeTwo store vendor directory. Shoppers see your name, photo, and page link. Free vendors are invisible.
- One booking from a directory click pays for years of membership.

### Starter → Growth ($197/mo = $6.57/day — less than lunch)
- Only 2 more sales to break even, but you earn 50% more on EVERY sale after that.
- Next 10 sales after break-even: $225 on Growth vs $150 on Starter. Same effort, 50% more money.
- Priority placement in vendor directory = more visibility = more bookings.

### Growth → Pro ($297/mo = $9.90/day — lunch money)
- Only 3 more sales than Starter to break even, but you earn DOUBLE per sale.
- Next 10 sales after break-even: $300 vs $150 on Starter. The gap explodes at volume.
- Top directory placement + featured vendor badge.

### Why Push Higher Tiers
The break-even difference is 2-3 extra sales. But the profit gap grows with every sale after that. At 30 sales/month, Pro earns $250 more than Starter — every month. That's $3,000/year more for just 3 extra sales to break even. Same effort, same links, same network.

### Shopify Vendor Directory (KEY UPGRADE LEVER)
- Only PAID vendors appear in the store
- Shoppers browsing the store see member vendors listed
- Name, photo, category, link to vendor page
- Free plan = not listed. You're invisible to store shoppers.
- This should be mentioned in every upgrade pitch.

## MESSAGE TEMPLATES — WHAT WORKS

### The exclusivity line that lands:
> "This isn't available to the public. You can't find it online. The only way to get it is through a member like me."

### The gift framing:
> "Gift from [Name]" appears on every purchase — linked to your page.

### The closing move:
> "One more thing — through my membership, you get 25% cashback on thousands of products. Nobody else can give you this."

### Instagram DM play:
> "DM me LINK" forces followers to reach out → warm leads

---

## VENDOR PERSONAS (who we're building for)

These are NOT tech people. Not marketers. Not business strategists.
- They likely don't understand "reactivation campaign" or "client acquisition"
- They need: "Here's what to do. Here's the exact words. Copy, paste, send."
- They need to feel like this is a GIFT they're giving, not a SALE they're making
- They need to see the competitive angle: "Nobody else can do this"

---

## NETWORK EFFECT — HOW TO EXPLAIN IT

Don't say "network effect." Say:
> "Every person you share with becomes a walking billboard for you. A couple's registry puts your name in front of 150 guests. Those guests click your name, land on your page, and some of them need a [category]. That's how one link turns into bookings."

## LEARNINGS LOG

### 2026-02-07
- Claude's math responses were too detailed — felt like homework. Simplified to napkin math.
- Told Claude not to recommend sharing with vendor friends — competitive edge, not kumbaya.
- Added Shopify vendor directory as upgrade lever — only paid vendors get listed.
- Vendors' first two questions: "How does this work?" and "What does it cost?" — built floating widget with those as pre-loaded prompts.
- Vendors don't read before asking — Claude widget must be immediately accessible.
- "WeTwo Wedding Buyers Club" + "Member Vendor" + "invitation-only" = the right positioning.
- "You are the only way in" = the most powerful line on the dashboard.

### 2026-02-07 (later)
- **THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS FREE.** This must be communicated clearly. Everything works on free — the page, the AI, the links, the contact form, the marketing system. No catch. They only pay if they want commission on sales.
- **Upgrade pitch framing:** "We built you this page, this system, this AI — all free. That's worth way more than $100/mo. Take that $97 and invest it in yourself for your launch. Lock in your commission BEFORE you start sharing. You don't have to keep it forever. 10 sales covers it."
- **Key insight:** If they're going to do the work of sharing links anyway, they should get paid for it. Don't leave money on the table.
- **Never pressure the upgrade.** The free plan genuinely works. But when someone is about to launch, help them see: invest before you push, not after.
- **Tone:** Confident friend, not salesperson. "Lock it in before you launch so you have no regrets."

### 2026-02-07 (wedding gift data)
- **Average wedding gift is $150, not $100.** Source: The Knot 2024 Guest Study, US News, NerdWallet. Close friends/family = $160+. This changes ALL the math.
- 7 sales covers Starter, not 10. Every plan pays for itself in under 10 sales.
- **THE REGISTRY BOMB:** One couple's registry = 150 guests × $150 = $22,500 in purchases. At 10% = $2,250 from ONE couple. This is the number that makes vendors' eyes go wide.
- Lead with simple napkin math ("7 sales covers your plan"), THEN drop the registry number as the kicker.
- Claude should cite "according to The Knot's 2024 study" when mentioning $150 avg — gives it credibility.

### 2026-02-07 (fundamental reframe)
- **DON'T START WITH "25% CASHBACK."** Vendors don't know what that means yet and don't care. Start with what WE gave THEM.
- **The correct order:**
  1. "We just built you a custom landing page for your business." (the gift to them)
  2. "Your page has a hook nobody else has — you can gift exclusive cashback." (the magnet)
  3. "All those leads that went cold? Now you have a reason to reach out." (the reactivation power)
  4. "Your name travels with every share." (the virality)
  5. "And it's all free." (remove all friction)
- **The reactivation angle is the killer insight.** How do you call a cold lead? "I learned a new song?" That's creepy. But "I have something valuable to give you" — that's a real reason. This is the game changer.
- **The page IS the product, the cashback IS the magnet.** Don't lead with the magnet. Lead with what they can see and touch — their page, their system, their tool.
- **Universal landing page positioning.** The vendor page should replace their LinkTree, their basic website link, everything. It goes on Instagram, business cards, email signatures, everywhere.

### 2026-02-07 (only tool that pays you back)
- **No tool in the wedding industry comes with a concrete way to make your money back.** The Knot, WeddingWire, HoneyBook, Dubsado, Flodesk — they all sell on faith. "This will help you get clients." "You'll be more organized." "Brides browse our site." Always nebulous. Never a real path.
- **WeTwo is the only tool that pays you back.** The subscription generates trackable revenue per transaction. You pay $97, you make $15/sale, 7 sales = profit. The money comes back through the same system.
- **The line that kills:** "Name one other tool you pay for that pays you back. This is the only one."
- **Dashboard rewrite:** The entire dashboard home now follows the narrative arc — what we gave you, the hook, the reactivation power, the network effect, it's all free, and the only tool that pays you back. Vendors shouldn't need Claude to understand the system — the dashboard tells the whole story.
- **Commission math and registry bomb are now ON the dashboard itself** — not hidden behind Claude.

### 2026-02-08 (profit over cost — the fundamental reframe)
- **The commission is spending money — a cherry on top.** The REAL value is what this system does for their main business. One booking from a reactivated lead or a registry guest = $2,000-$10,000+. That's the real math.
- **Lead with daily cost, not monthly.** Starter = $3.23/day (a cup of coffee). Growth = $6.57/day (less than lunch). Pro = $9.90/day (lunch money). The expense won't change their life. But what it unlocks absolutely can.
- **The higher tier wins on tiny marginal cost.** Break-even difference between tiers is just 2-3 extra sales. But every sale after that, the gap explodes. Next 10 sales after break-even: $150 Starter / $225 Growth / $300 Pro. Same effort, same links, same network.
- **Added "Why the higher tier wins" section** to earnings page with visual comparison.
- **Added "How the gap grows" bar chart** showing monthly profit at 15/20/30/50 sales — the visual makes the argument for Growth/Pro instantly.
- **Added "The real ROI isn't the commission" section** — three cards: landing page → bookings, reactivated leads → bookings, network effect → exposure. Closes with: "A single booking is worth $2,000-$10,000+. The commission? Cherry on top."
- **Updated upgrade nudge:** "The expense won't change your life. But what it unlocks absolutely can."
- **Updated Claude's brain** with profit-over-cost framing, daily cost math, cherry-on-top positioning, and higher-tier push rationale.
